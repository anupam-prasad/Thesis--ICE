Introduction
 -> Problem description
 -> Hearing in vertebrates
 -> Localization techniques
 -> Coupled ears - directional sensitivity -- overall sensitivity trade-off.
			--> Insects, Birds, Frogs, Lizards
 -> Previous work - Vossen, Manley, Dalsgaard, Carr, KÃ¶ppl

Main Body
 -> Model description/justification
		   	--> Discuss differences with mammalian ear - extracolumella vs stapes
			--> Input, diffraction effects
 -> Equations of motion --> Membrane, sectoral membrane, infinite mass extracolumella
			    ---> Membrane modes	
			--> Cavity - general cavity/cylindrical cavity
			--> Pressure distribution, plane-wave approximation
			--> Volume displacement
			--> Circuit model - explain why it will not work in this case
 -> Comparison of results --> Velocity Amplitude
			  --> Amplitude difference
			  --> Directional response for frequency
			  --> Hearing Range
			  --> iTD, iLD range
			
Conclusion
