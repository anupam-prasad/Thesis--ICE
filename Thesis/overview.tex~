\section{Done so far}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Circular membranes coupled through an air-cavity of arbitrary shape (quasi-static process assumption).
 \item Circular membranes coupled through cylindrical air cavity assuming linear acoustics inside cavity. Reduces
 to the previous system when $\lambda \gg L$.
 \item Membrane with infinite mass extra-columella coupled through an air-cavity of arbitrary shape. Non-symmetric shapes
 already appear in this case.
\end{itemize}
Note: Steady state solution for the three above cases.
\section{To be done}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Transient response, i.e., membrane profile at $t=0^+$. Needed to justify that the steady state solution
 is enough. This requires estimate of $\alpha$ - damping coefficient.
 \item Membrane with finite mass extra-columella. I've written down a solution to the analogous problem in 1D - a
 string clamped at one end and attached to a finite mass (can be an extended object) at the other. 
\end{itemize}
