``\emph{Oh Christ, the exhaustion of not knowing anything. It’s so tiring and hard on the nerves. 
It really takes it out of you, not knowing anything. You’re given comedy and miss all the jokes. 
Every hour, you get weaker. Sometimes, I sit alone in my London flat and stare at the window, 
I think how dismal it is, how hard, how heavy, to watch the rain and not know why it falls. }''\\

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I should and will begin by thanking my advisor Prof. Dr. J. Leo van Hemmen
for introducing me to the far from uninteresting world of lizards and
the clever things they do to figure out what's what and who's where. His combination
of patience and enthusiasm was indispensable. The same can, should and will be said
about Dr. Julie Goulet without whose guidance this thesis would be around 80
pages too short.

I would also

Last but not the least, Mr. V., Mrs. V. and Shweta for their unconditional and sometimes
inexplicable support.
