ICE is a general model that explains the enhancement of directional hearing cues (viz. amplitude, phase difference) in animals such
as lizards which have eardrums that are coupled through the mouth cavity. In this thesis we will propose a geometric model for such a system
 as an extension of Vossen's \cite{vossenjasa}. The model enables us to calculate the complete vibration profile of the tympanic
 membrane driven by the internal and external pressures. The directional cues can then be defined in terms of the phase and 
 amplitude differences between the membrane vibrations. These cues, known respectively as the internal time and level differences (iTDs and iLDs),
 show a strong directionality. The validity of the model is evaluated by comparing the frequency and direction dependence
 of these cues with membrane vibration data taken from live gekkonids. The model also enables to propose possible frequency regimes for the use of iTDs and iLDs.
