->Justify steady state approximation
	--> Pressure case also?
->Separation Constants

-> Steady state - long time after force is switched on.
 --> We'll justify this in a later slide.
-> Transient - immediately after switching on.

->Mention membrane parameters
-> Spatial part of membrane modes.
->f_0 vs c_M
