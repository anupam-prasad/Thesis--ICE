\chapter{Evaluation of the ICE--Model}\label{modelanalysischapter}
We now have a complete geomtrical representation of the ICE model as well as
 the analytical expressions $u_0$ and $u_L$ that describe the membrane displacements
in spatial detail as a function of direction and frequency. In this chapter we will use these variables
to further study the features of our model and compare them with experimental results.

In our study we are primarily concerned with hearing in geckos. We will be using
parameters (interaural separation, tympanum area etc.) from \textit{Hemidactylus frenatus}, the common house gecko
\cite{dalsgaardmanley2}
and the Tokay gecko \cite{dalsgaardtangcarr}. We do this primarily to demonstrate the universality of our model with respect to animals
hearing with coupled ears.

We will define and study the two main quantities that serve as important localization
cues - the Internal Time Differene (iTD) and the Internal Level Difference (iLD). This
is in contrast to the Interaural Time and Level Differences (ITD and ILD) that are
entirely determined by the inputs to the two ears.
