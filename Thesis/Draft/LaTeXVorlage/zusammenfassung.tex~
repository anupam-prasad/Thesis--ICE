ICE is a general model for the production of directional cues in hearing in animals with
tympani that are coupled through the mouth cavity. We first describe the geometric model
for such a system as a cylindrical air cavity closed on either end by linear elastic sectoral 
membranes, i.e. circular membranes with one rigid non-moving sector.
