\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I should and will begin by thanking my advisor Prof. Dr. J. Leo van Hemmen
for introducing me to the far from uninteresting world of lizards and
the clever things they do to figure out what's what and who's where. His combination
of patience and enthusiasm was indispensable. The same can, should and will be said
about Dr. Julie Goulet without whose guidance this thesis would be short by about 80
pages.
