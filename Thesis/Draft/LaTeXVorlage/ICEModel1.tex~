\chapter{The ICE Model}

Our goal is to model the
middle-ear of the vertebrates in question in the simplest possible way while ensuring an accurately replication of its main properties. 
The main components of such a 
system are the mouth-cavity, the two tympani and the two extracollumellar
footplates (one on each tympanum). In general, the shape of the mouth-cavity is highly irregular and therefore
not conducive to an analytical treatment. Moreover, the system corresponds to a pair of second-order PDE's with
moving boundaries. For this reason we will need to make further approximations for the sake of expediency.

\section{Description}
In the earlier treatment of the ICE model, the mouth canal is modelled as a simple cylinder closed at 
both ends by rigidly clamped (baffled) circular membranes. As shown in \ref{oldICE}, The length of the cylinder was chosen to be equal
to the interaural distance. The advantage of using a cylindrical cavity model for the mouth cavity is that the pressure
distribution inside the cavity is easy to calculate - something that is even more important at higher frequencies
as the pressure distribution inside the cavity is highly non-uniform. 

The problem with this description is the fact that the volume of the model's cavity 
is an order of magnitude smaller than that of the mouth-cavity in the corresponding animal with similar
tympani and a the same interaural distance. In general, a smaller volume results in a stronger coupling - both in terms of an increased iTD and an increased
iLD. For this reason, the earlier model overestimates the iTDs at low frequencies and the iLDs at
high frequencies respectively.
